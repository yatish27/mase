# Abstraction (Advanced Python Coding)



Layers within layers within layers..

In the following, we will
divide the problem into layers of abstraction where `iterators`
separate out the various concerns. Easier to debug! Good
Zen Python coding.


## Background

From Wikipedia:

+ In computer science, abstraction is a technique for managing complexity of computer systems. 
+ It works by establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level. 
+ The programmer works with an idealized interface (usually well defined) and can add additional levels of functionality that would otherwise be too complex to handle. 
  + For example, a programmer writing code that involves numerical operations may not be interested in the way numbers are represented in the underlying hardware (e.g. whether they're 16 bit or 32 bit integers), and where those details have been suppressed it can be said that they were abstracted away, leaving simply numbers with which the programmer can work. 
  + In addition, a task of sending an email message across continents would be extremely complex if you start with a piece of optic cable and basic hardware components. 
By using layers of complexity that have been created to abstract away the physical cables, network layout and presenting the programmer with a virtual data channel, this task is manageable.

Abstraction can apply to control or to data: Control abstraction is the abstraction of actions while data abstraction is that of data structures.

+ _Data abstraction_ allows handling data bits in meaningful ways. For example, it is the basic motivation behind datatype and object-oriented programming.
+ _Control abstraction_ involves the use of subprograms and related concepts control flows

The rest of this page is about control abstraction, as implemented by Python's iterator. If a functions `return` statement
is replaced with `yield` then that function becomes a _generator_, whose internal details can now be ignored.

For example, if you want to launch a rocket....

```python
def countdown(n):
   while n >= 0:
     yield n
     n -= 1

print("We are go for launch")
for x in countdown(10):
   print(x)
print("lift off!")
```

And here's my favorite iterator that descends recursive lists:

"""
def items(x, depth=-1):
  if isinstance(x,(list,tuple)):
    for y in x:
      for z in items(y, depth+1):
        yield z
  else:
    yield depth,x
"""

This lets me do things like (a) traverse a nested structure and (b) write pretty print that structure.
For example:

```python
for depth,x in items(  [10,
                        [   20,
                            30],
                        40,
                        [   (  50,
                               60,
                               70),
                            [  80,
                               90,
                               100],
                            110]]):
  print(" |.. " *depth,x)
```
Output:

```
10
 |..  20
 |..  30
 40
 |..  |..  50
 |..  |..  60
 |..  |..  70
 |..  |..  80
 |..  |..  90
 |..  |..  100
 |..  110
```

Anyway, lets apply this idea to a real problem. 


## Problem

If   parsing 1,000,000
records, in a table of data, keep  a small sample
of that large space, without blowing memory.

How?

+ Read a table of data and keep some sample of each column.
  Specifically, keep up to `max` things (and if we see more than that,
  delete older values).

"""
r = random.random
rseed = random.seed

class Some:
  def __init__(i, max=8): # note, usually 256 or 128 or 64 (if brave)
    i.n, i.any, i.max = 0,[],max
  def __iadd__(i,x):
    i.n += 1
    now = len(i.any)
    if now < i.max:    # not full yet, so just keep it   
      i.any += [x]
    elif r() <= float(now)/i.n:
      i.any[ int(r() * now) ]= x # zap some older value
    #else: forget x
    return i

@ok
def _some():
  rseed(1)
  s = Some(16)
  for i in xrange(100000):
    s += i
  assert sorted(s.any)== [ 5852, 24193, 28929, 38266,
                          41764, 42926, 51310, 52203,
                          54651, 56743, 59368, 60794,
                          61888, 82586, 83018, 88462]
"""
Turns out, we do not lose much (caveat: need to keep more than 16... 256 seems a reasonable default).

Note that the table is messy- blank lines, spaces, comments,
some lines split over multiple physical lines.  
Also:

+ there are some columns we just want to ignore (see `?windy`)
+  when we read these strings, we need to coerce
  these values to either strings, ints, or floats.
+ This string has rows belonging to different `klass`es
  (see last column). We want our tables to keep counts
  separately for each column.

Lets handle all that mess with iterators.
